### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Will, I'm a full-stack developer in the Bay Area. I'm an assistant instructor at Skill Distillery where I help students learn topics from basic Java syntax to building their own full-stack applications with Spring Boot and Angular.

I also love learning about the future of engineering, from Web3 to Machine Learning, and am excited to find an opportunity to contribute to something I'm passionate about.
